# Neural-Network-from-scratch-without-TensorFlow-PyTorch
This repository features a simple two-layer neural network trained on the MNIST dataset using Python and NumPy. It covers data preprocessing, forward and backward propagation, gradient descent for parameter updates, and model evaluation, offering an educational exploration of neural networks without external frameworks.
